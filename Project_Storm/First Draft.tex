\section{The Team}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item {Renaldo van Dyk (12204359)\par}
			
		\begin{itemize}		
			\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{Renaldo} %Example is the name of the image		
			\item Interests\newline\newline
				I'm a lover of technology in general and fortunate enough to pertain to it's value. I love knowing that 
				every page of code that I write will help improve someone in their day-to-day life. I mostly favor web and 
				mobile app development and I'm also intrigued by security and privacy aspects of information technology.\newline
			\item My technical strong points:
				\begin{itemize}
				\item Java\newline
					Java programming is one of my strong points and I have been using the java language extensively for 3 years.
				\item XML\newline
					XML have been used throughout the course of 4 years in my degree. We have learned how to use it 
					in different environments and I have experimented with it in my own time by writing small android apps.
				\item Web Technologies\newline
					PHP, Javascript, HTML, JQuery, AJAX, XML are some of my well developed skills.
				\item Other Languages\newline
					Visual C\#\newline
					C++\newline
					C\newline
					ASP.net\newline
					SQL\newline
					UML\newline	
				\end{itemize}				
			\item Past experience relevant to project\newline\newline
				I have worked with web technologies for 5 years, in my field of study and in the more corporate 							environment. This experience will be crucial in the development of the web application. I have worked on some artificial intelligent applications making use of smart algorithms. I am familiar with a vast variety of data structures and how to shuffle or traverse them efficiently.\newline
			\item Non-technical strengths\newline\newline
				I am  a strong perfectionist, this means I will not attempt a project if I am not 100\% sure that I will succeed. I am driven and always do my utmost best to reach deadlines.  Some of my characteristics include:\newline 
Reliable\newline
Leader\newline
Precise\newline
Hard Working\newline
Passionate\newline
Loyal\newline
			\item What makes you want to do the project\newline\newline
				I would say web development is my strongest area of expertise. I have always loved to challenge myself 						with complex and intelligent algorithms. I will gain a lot of knowledge and experience from this 								project. I know that this project will help the CS department improve the course for future students.\newline
		\end{itemize}
		\item {Johann Dian Marx (12105202)\par}
		\begin{itemize}
				\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{Dian} %Example is the name of the image
			\item Interests\newline\newline
				My main interest is new technology. Mainly developing new software that not only enhances our daily lives,
				but also improves the safety of our data on our mobile devices.\newline
				
				I enjoy mobile development, as well as researching (and attending seminars on) security on electronic devices.
			\item Technical Skills\newline
				\begin{itemize}
				\item {\bf Java}\newline
					Not only have I been using Java for degree purposes the past 4 years, it is also my preferred coding language
					outside the confines of the university.
				\item {\bf XML}\newline
					I have used XML during my degree, and I have learned how to use it effectively.
				\item {\bf Web Technologies}\newline
					The web technologies I have acquired during my studies include, but are not limited to :
					PHP, Javascript(Used extensively by our group on the COS 301 mini-project), HTML, JQuery, AJAX, CSS.
				\item {\bf Other Languages}\newline
					Visual C\#\newline
					C++\newline
					SQL\newline
					UML\newline	
					Fortran\newline
					COBOL\newline
					Assembly\newline
					Pascal\newline
				\item {\bf Helpfull to the project}\newline
					Together with the programming skills I have acquired through the University of Pretoria, I have also done various online
					courses on Mobile Application Development(More so on Android than any other OS), as well as various courses on mobile security
					(This together with the vast amounts of research I have done on the matter).\newline
				\end{itemize}
			\item Past experience relevant to project\newline\newline
				I have worked for Corporate Companies on large projects before, which will help in the time management of the project,
				as well as the technical difficulties we might encounter.
				
				I have done some mobile development before, creating applications to be used locally between the employees of a company, which helped me 
				develop not only my knowledge of the Android environment, but also the security risks associated with sensitive information.
				
				I have worked with large groups of people, as well as individually, which I feel has prepared me for the peer programming part of the work and the individual part.\newline
			\item Non-technical strengths\newline\newline
				I have good time management skills, excel at managing groups of people, work exceptionally well under stress
				and pride myself in the work I deliver.
				I enjoy a good challenge and think this project has just enough of that to keep me going for a while. I feel the following words of Sally Hawkins are applicable here: "You only do good work when you're taking risks and pushing yourself".\newline
			\item What makes you want to do the project\newline\newline
				I am excited to work on security related projects. Working on a project for the CSIR and DPSS will help in my understanding of security measures in the Android environment, as we will have to do extensive research on the matter.
				
				Being able to say that we were part of the team that helped develop a process to keep sensitive information within the confines of the meeting space
				will also be a proud moment in any developer's student career. \newline

\section{Project Execution}
	\subsection{Development Methodology}
		We will be working with the waterfall methodology, as this is a fairly linearizable project.
	\subsection{How to keep the client informed about the status of the project}
		Bi-weekly meetings will be scheduled with the client to discuss progress of the project, potential problems and any further arrangements. Furthermore we will communicate via email for any urgent queries or information needing to reach the client. More urgent matters can be discussed in person seeing that the client is on campus. 
	\subsection{Initial ideas on solving some of the technical challenges}
		Fill in later...
	\subsection{Technologies we intend to use for the project}
		Seeing that the application will be deployed on a web server some web technologies will have to be considered.
		It is also important that we are comfortable with the technologies that we choose thus we have considered the following:\newline
		PHP - As server side language\newline
		HTML5 - As web front end (includes CSS3 for styling)\newline
		Javascript - As client side language and communications with the server (includes AJAX, JQuery and JSON)
		WEBSTORM - As IDE for development.
		Mongoose - This can be used as a database for storing student information
	\subsection{What the client will receive from us at the end of the project}
		Full functional requirements specification\newline
		Full architectural requirements specification\newline
		Unit Tests\newline
		Source Code\newline
		Instructions and release notes\newline
		Full functioning application hosted on a web server\newline	
	\subsection{Etc.}
		We are very excited to start working on project STORM and we'll certainly not let you down.
