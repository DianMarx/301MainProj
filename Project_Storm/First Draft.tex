				I'm a lover of technology in general and fortunate enough to pertain to it's value. I love knowing that 						every page of code that I write will help improve someone in their day-to-day life.

					XML have been used throughout the course of 4 years in my degree. We have learned how to use it 
					in different environments and I have experimented with it in my own time by writing small android apps.
				\item Web Technologies\newline
					PHP, Javascript, HTML, JQuery, AJAX, XML are some of my well developed skills.
				\item Other Languages\newline
					Visual C\#\newline
					C++\newline
