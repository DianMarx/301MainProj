\section{The Team}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item {Renaldo van Dyk (12204359)\par}
			
		\begin{itemize}		
			\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{Renaldo} %Example is the name of the image		
			\item Interests\newline\newline
				I'm a lover of technology in general and fortunate enough to pertain to it's value. I love knowing that 
				every page of code that I write will help improve someone in their day-to-day life. I mostly favour web and 
				mobile app development and I'm also intruiged by security and privacy aspects of information technology.\newline
			\item My technical strong points:
				\begin{itemize}
				\item Java\newline
					Java programming is one of my strong points and I have been using the java language extensively for 3 years.
				\item XML\newline
					XML have been used throughout the course of 4 years in my degree. We have learned how to use it 
					in different environments and I have experimented with it in my own time by writing small android apps.
				\item Web Technologies\newline
					PHP, Javascript, HTML, JQuery, AJAX, XML are some of my well developed skills.
				\item Other Languages\newline
					Visual C\#\newline
					C++\newline
					C\newline
					ASP.net\newline
					SQL\newline
					UML\newline	
				\end{itemize}				
			\item Past experience relevant to project\newline\newline
				I have worked on small Android apps, experimenting with some functionality including Wi-Fi, GEO location, voice recording etc. in order to get familiar with the Android SDK. The core of Android development lies in Java and XML. I have studied these languages to a great extent. This will make it easier for me to implement the mobile application and mobile malware.  I have worked with web technologies for 5 years, in my field of study and in the more corporate environment. This experience will be crucial in the development of the web server application.\newline
			\item Non-technical strengths\newline\newline
				I am  a strong perfectionist, this means I will not attemp a project if I am not 100\% sure that I will succeed. I am driven and always do my utmost best to reach deadlines.  Some of my charactaristics include:\newline 
Reliable\newline
Leader\newline
Precise\newline
Hard Working\newline
Passionate\newline
Loyal\newline
			\item What makes you want to do the project\newline\newline
				I love working with mobile development and web development and this project has a mixture of both. The fact that I have to write a malware application to test the mobile application intruiges me. I will gain a lot of experience and knoledge in the area of  development that I'm most interested in.\newline
		\end{itemize}
		\item {Johann Dian Marx (12105202)\par}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Photo\newline
				\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{Dian} %Example is the name of the image
			\item Interests\newline
				My main interest is new technology. Mainly developing new software that not only enhances our daily lives,
				but also improves the safety of our data on our mobile devices.
				
				I enjoy mobile development, as well as researching (and attending seminars on) security on electronic devices.
			\item Technical Skills\newline
				\begin{itemize}
				\item {\bf Java}\newline
					Not only have I been using Java for degree purposes the past 4 years, it is also my preferred coding language
					outside the confines of the university.
				\item {\bf XML}\newline
					I have used XML during my degree, and I have learned how to use it effectively.
				\item {\bf Web Technologies}\newline
					The web technologies I have acquired during my studies include, but are not limited to :
					PHP, Javascript(Used extensively by our group on the COS 301 mini-project), HTML, JQuery, AJAX, CSS.
				\item {\bf Other Languages}\newline
					Visual C\#\newline
					C++\newline
					SQL\newline
					UML\newline	
					Fortran\newline
					COBOL\newline
					Assembly\newline
					Pascal\newline
				\item {\bf Helpfull to the project}\newline
					Together with the programming skills I have acquired through the University of Pretoria, I have also done various online
					courses on Mobile Application Development(More so on Android than any other OS), as well as various courses on mobile security
					(This together with the vast amounts of research I have done on the matter).
				\end{itemize}
			\item Past experience relevant to project\newline
				I have worked for Corporate Companies on large projects before, which will help in the time management of the project,
				as well as the technical difficulties we might encounter.
				
				I have done some mobile development before, creating applications to be used locally between the employees of a company, which helped me 
				develop not only my knowledge of the Android environment, but also the security risks associated with sensitive information.
				
				I have worked with large groups of people, as well as individually, which I feel has prepared me for the peer programming part of the work and the individual part.
			\item Non-technical strengths\newline
				I have good time management skills, excel at managing groups of people, work exceptionally well under stress
				and pride myself in the work I deliver.
				I enjoy a good challenge and think this project has just enough of that to keep me going for a while. I feel the following words of Sally Hawkins are applicable here: "You only do good work when you're taking risks and pushing yourself".
			\item What makes you want to do the project\newline
				I am excited to work on security related projects. Working on a project for the CSIR and DPSS will help in my understanding of security measures in the Android environment, as we will have to do extensive research on the matter.
				
				Being able to say that we were part of the team that helped develop a process to keep sensitive information within the confines of the meeting space
				will also be a proud moment in any developer's student career.

		\item {Sean Thomas Hill (12221458)\par}
		\begin{itemize}
				\item Photo\newline
								\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{example}
					\item Interests\newline
								I'm interested in creating things that I can be proud of, and I'm excited about learning how to use a wider variety of ways to interact with the latest technology.
								Where software development is concerned I enjoy web and application development and would like to gain some more experience in mobile development as well.
								
							\item Technical Skills\newline
								\begin{itemize}
								\item {\bf Java}\newline
									Three and a half years of experience in study.
								\item {\bf XML}\newline
									Extensive knowledge in xml document creation and handling of xml markup in a wide variety of coding environments as well as xml styling and template based document creation from xml documents.
								\item {\bf Web Technologies}\newline
									I am proficient in JavaScript, HTML, PHP, related database interactions and styling.
								\item {\bf Database Technologies}\newline
								MySQL, neo4j, PL/pgSQL, postGIS, db4o and mongoDB.
								\item {\bf Other Languages}\newline
									C++\newline
									Visual C\#\newline
									UML\newline	
									ASP.net\newline
									Assembly\newline
								\end{itemize}
							\item A bit of toying with the android SDK to see how it works, 4 years of study in Java and XML, which are used in android development. A subject on operating systems, which will help with the SMS interception in the second part of the project.
							\item Non-technical strengths\newline
								I am a natural problem solver, a reliable worker and driven to complete the tasks at hand. Honesty is important to me. I am passionate about the projects we are tendering for and that means that I will do my very best to make it run perfectly. I like to keep things light and will always stay level-headed. I work well under pressure.
							\item What makes you want to do the project\newline
								This project is by far the most interesting one we were offered to choose from. Aside from getting the opportunity to have the CSIR on my resume, everything about this just seems cool. I believe that the experience from using NFC will be very valuable as its capabilities are appearing on more and more devices. The fact that this project crosses over between digital and physical security intrigues me, as does the challenge of it all. As soon as I started reading the project overview, I knew I would want to do it the most. If we are given this opportunity, I promise to deliver my best possible work. You will not be sorry.

\section{Project Execution}
	\subsection{Development Methodology}
		Because there is more than one aspect to this project (3 Objectives), we have decided to work with the Spiral
		model and combining it with Prototyping(Prototyping because the client expects at least 4 iterations).
		We feel that this will assist in the timely completion of the project, as well as give the client a better sense of 
		progress because we will have a few smaller demo projects, instead of a once off big demo session where some of the information may get lost in the jungle of documentation.
		
	\subsection{How to keep the client informed about the status of the project}
		The client will receive weekly updates on our progress, as well as updated schedules after our bi-weekly group meetings on the matter.
		We will also book well in advance for meetings a week before all major project demos.
