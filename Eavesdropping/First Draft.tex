\section{The Team}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item {Renaldo van Dyk (12204359)\par}
			
		\begin{itemize}		
			\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{Renaldo} %Example is the name of the image		
			\item Interests\newline\newline
				I'm a lover of technology in general and fortunate enough to pertain to it's value. I love knowing that 
				every page of code that I write will help improve someone in their day-to-day life. I mostly favour web and 
				mobile app development and I'm also intruiged by security and privacy aspects of information technology.\newline
			\item My technical strong points:
				\begin{itemize}
				\item Java\newline
					Java programming is one of my strong points and I have been using the java language extensively for 3 years.
				\item XML\newline
					XML have been used throughout the course of 4 years in my degree. We have learned how to use it 
					in different environments and I have experimented with it in my own time by writing small android apps.
				\item Web Technologies\newline
					PHP, Javascript, HTML, JQuery, AJAX, XML are some of my well developed skills.
				\item Other Languages\newline
					Visual C\#\newline
					C++\newline
					C\newline
					ASP.net\newline
					SQL\newline
					UML\newline	
				\end{itemize}				
			\item Past experience relevant to project\newline\newline
				I have worked on small Android apps, experimenting with some functionality including Wi-Fi, GEO location, voice recording etc. in order to get familiar with the Android SDK. The core of Android development lies in Java and XML. I have studied these languages to a great extent. This will make it easier for me to implement the mobile application and mobile malware.  I have worked with web technologies for 5 years, in my field of study and in the more corporate environment. This experience will be crucial in the development of the web server application.\newline
			\item Non-technical strengths\newline\newline
				I am  a strong perfectionist, this means I will not attemp a project if I am not 100\% sure that I will succeed. I am driven and always do my utmost best to reach deadlines.  Some of my charactaristics include:\newline 
Reliable\newline
Leader\newline
Precise\newline
Hard Working\newline
Passionate\newline
Loyal\newline
			\item What makes you want to do the project\newline\newline
				I love working with mobile development and web development and this project has a mixture of both. The fact that I have to write a malware application to test the mobile application intruiges me. I will gain a lot of experience and knoledge in the area of  development that I'm most interested in.\newline

		\item {Sean Thomas Hill (12221458)\par}
		\begin{itemize}
				\item Photo\newline
								\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{example}
					\item Interests\newline
								I'm interested in creating things that I can be proud of, and I'm excited about learning how to use a wider variety of ways to interact with the latest technology.
								Where software development is concerned I enjoy web and application development and would like to gain some more experience in mobile development as well.
								
							\item Technical Skills\newline
								\begin{itemize}
								\item {\bf Java}\newline
									Three and a half years of experience in study.
								\item {\bf XML}\newline
									Extensive knowledge in xml document creation and handling of xml markup in a wide variety of coding environments as well as xml styling and template based document creation from xml documents.
								\item {\bf Web Technologies}\newline
									I am proficient in JavaScript, HTML, PHP, related database interactions and styling.
								\item {\bf Database Technologies}\newline
								MySQL, neo4j, PL/pgSQL, postGIS, db4o and mongoDB.
								\item {\bf Other Languages}\newline
									C++\newline
									Visual C\#\newline
									UML\newline	
									ASP.net\newline
									Assembly\newline
								\end{itemize}
							\item A bit of toying with the android SDK to see how it works, 4 years of study in Java and XML, which are used in android development. A subject on operating systems, which will help with the SMS interception in the second part of the project.
							\item Non-technical strengths\newline
								I am a natural problem solver, a reliable worker and driven to complete the tasks at hand. Honesty is important to me. I am passionate about the projects we are tendering for and that means that I will do my very best to make it run perfectly. I like to keep things light and will always stay level-headed. I work well under pressure.
							\item What makes you want to do the project\newline
								This project is by far the most interesting one we were offered to choose from. Aside from getting the opportunity to have the CSIR on my resume, everything about this just seems cool. I believe that the experience from using NFC will be very valuable as its capabilities are appearing on more and more devices. The fact that this project crosses over between digital and physical security intrigues me, as does the challenge of it all. As soon as I started reading the project overview, I knew I would want to do it the most. If we are given this opportunity, I promise to deliver my best possible work. You will not be sorry.

			\item Past experience relevant to project\newline
				I have worked for big corporate companies to help make their processes better and faster, by writing 						certain small programs to achieve big results. This included databases, statistics, macros, XML, Java and 						web-development. I have used web-development during my degree and I have learned all of the 							languages above during my studies. I have done some mobile app development during my second year of study.
			\item Non-technical strengths\newline
				I am very motivated and will always strive to reach my goals in time. I set personal goals to help achieve 						the goals of the project. I am a fast learner, a good listener and I will always help other team members 						where I can. I have a healthy balance between perfectionism and time management. I am honest, a hard 						worker and loyal. I enjoy a challenge that I can learn from, to broaden my knowledge. I have good 							general knowledge and I am not afraid to take the lead on a project.
			\item What makes you want to do the project\newline
				I enjoy doing mobile-development and web-development. This project has a mixture of mobile-							development and web-development. This project will be a challenge, but it will be very interesting. I am 						looking forward to see an application like Eavesdropping and the protection against it. I would love to be 						part of the development of such an application.
